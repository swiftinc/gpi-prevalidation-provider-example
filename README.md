# gpi Pre-Validation API Provider Example

## Overview
This is a example implementation of the pre-validation API provider using JAX-RS Jersey2 framework. The server was generated by [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) with the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://developer.swift.com/api/prevalidation/v1/reference).

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then call the API at this URL:

```
https://localhost:7443/v1/accounts/verification
```

You can also clone the [gpi Connector Backoffice Simulator](https://github.com/swiftinc/gpi-connector-backoffice-simulator) containing a postman collection with client requests addressing multiple success and error scenarios.
